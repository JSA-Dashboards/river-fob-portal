"""net_carry.py — "Net Carry" analysis for a location's forward basis curve.

For one location (a scraped basis location OR a rail corridor) it takes the
forward set of (delivery, own-futures, basis) quotes and produces the columns on
Kolten's Net Carry sheet:

    Delivery | Basis vs REF | Interest | Net of Interest Basis | Inverse(+)/Carry(-)

Definitions (confirmed against Kolten's screenshot):
  • **Basis vs REF** — every delivery's basis re-expressed against ONE common
    futures contract (the reference), so the levels are comparable across the curve:
        basis_ref = raw_basis + futures_spread
        futures_spread = futures(own contract) - futures(reference)       (cents)
    The futures spread is the credit a delivery gets for being quoted off a later (or
    earlier) month than the reference — the market's own carry along the futures
    curve. By default the reference is the contract the FRONT delivery is quoted off
    (the front reads exactly as quoted; every later month is credited its spread vs
    that contract); the alternative is the nearest new-crop contract. (Same algebra as
    futures_spread.anchor_basis.) Because the reference only shifts every row by the
    same constant, it never changes the carry BETWEEN deliveries (except through the
    interest base, the reference's board price).
  • **Interest** — the cost of carrying grain from an anchor month forward, priced
    exactly like the Cost of Carry sheet (cost-of-carry-calculator, interest_full):
        interest = ref_price × annual_rate × days / 360
    where `days` is the actual calendar days from the first of the anchor month to the
    first of the delivery month, and annual_rate is fed funds + 2.25% (see carry_rate).
    Deliveries at or before the anchor month carry no interest (blank). (Until
    2026-10-04 this was months × (ref_price × a hand-set 9% / 12) — too high.)
  • **Net of Interest Basis** = Basis vs REF − Interest.
  • **Inverse(+)/Carry(-)** = prior delivery's Net − this delivery's Net.
    Positive ⇒ inverse (market pays to move now); negative ⇒ carry (market pays
    to store). Blank on the first (nearest) delivery.
  • **NC / New Crop** quotes (no month named) are the harvest-time bid — the earliest
    new-crop delivery — so they are placed AT the carry anchor and sorted first (see
    is_new_crop), not at their futures contract's month.
  • `monthly_carry` collapses weekly / half-month / duplicate slots to ONE point per calendar
    month — the slot with the HIGHEST net of interest, so the monthly curve never hides a better
    quote that the table shows — and measures each against the PREVIOUS quoted month. That is
    the charts; the table keeps every slot. `top_of_net_carry` finds the month where that
    curve peaks (the highest Net of Interest, from the carry start on).

Everything is in cents/bu, matching the rest of the app.
