"""river_carry.py — the River FOB sheet archive as Net Carry / Return to Carry inputs.

The River FOB portal archives one sheet per as-of date (weekly since 2006-09, daily lately) in Snowflake RIVER_FOB.PUBLIC:

    cif_history       as_of, commodity, month, value    the CIF NOLA basis by delivery month ($/bu)
    freight_history   as_of, region,    month, value    barge freight by reach and month (a multiple of the tariff, 6.1 = 610%)
    calendar_history  as_of, commodity, seq, month, contract   the sheet's delivery months in order and the futures month each is priced off

and the sheet's own rule turns them into the FOB barge basis of every river location (fob_model):

    FOB[location][month] = CIF[month] - tariff factor x freight[reach][month] / 2000 x bushel weight

so twenty years of weekly forward curves exist for every river location even though no one wrote a report on them.
This module reads that into the shapes the Net Carry tab already consumes — pure functions over the loaded archive
(river_fob_data.load_archive), no database and no Streamlit:

    curve_items(archive, as_of, location, commodity)       one date's forward curve  [{'delivery', 'futures', 'basis'}]  (cents)
    nearby_obs(archive, location, commodity)               the weekly nearby FOB     [{'date', 'basis', 'tag'}]          (cents)
    forward_quotes(archive, location, commodity)           every posted month        [{'date', 'label', 'tag', 'basis'}] (cents)

`nearby_obs` and `forward_quotes` are what return_to_carry_data's tracker and shipment table take in place of a rail
corridor's or an elevator's bids.

How a sheet column becomes a delivery month and a futures contract
  * A sheet column is a calendar MONTH label ('Oct', 'July', 'Sept', and in 2023-25 a leading 'Spot') with no year. The
    first month starts at the sheet's date (0-2 months ahead) and each later column is the next such month. A sheet whose
    first month is already behind its date (stale headers) is set aside rather than guessed at.
  * The contract code ('CZ', 'SX') is the sheet's own mapping for that date; its year is the occurrence of that month letter
    NEAREST the delivery month (5 months before to 6 after): Dec 2026 + 'CH' is ZCH27, Jan 2027 + 'CH' is ZCH27.
  * 'Spot' is the prompt bid in the sheet's own month. When the sheet also has that month's column the month wins (the
    Spot cell is the same grain priced a day earlier), so a month is never quoted twice.
  * Only columns with a CIF and a barge freight give a FOB. A freight cell of 0 or blank means the river is closed at that
    reach (the upper river in winter) and the FOB is left undefined, never computed against zero freight (fob_model.fob_value).
