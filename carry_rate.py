"""carry_rate.py — the annual interest rate behind the Cost of Carry sheet's interest cost.

The Net Carry tab used to charge a flat, hand-set 9%. The Cost of Carry calculator
(cost-of-carry-calculator/app.py) prices interest as

    interest = price × annual_rate × days / 360        annual_rate = fed funds + 2.25%

so this module supplies that rate for any as-of date: the **effective fed funds rate on
the day plus the same fixed spread**. `FED_FUNDS_SPREAD_PCT` and `FALLBACK_ANNUAL_RATE_PCT`
mirror that app's constants of the same names — it is the source of truth, so change them
there first.

Source of the history: Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (US), Federal
Funds Effective Rate [DFF], via FRED (https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/DFF). Public
domain, citation requested. DFF is published for every calendar day (weekends carry the
prior business day). The live FRED download is preferred; if it is unreachable the
committed snapshot in data/fed_funds_dff.csv is used instead, and if that is missing too
the 5.89% fallback applies. Refresh the snapshot with `python carry_rate.py` (that also refreshes the prime snapshot below).

One small convention difference from the Cost of Carry app: there, *today's* rate is the
front-month ZQ fed-funds FUTURES price (100 − price) from the Massive API; its history
(and this module, always) uses the EFFECTIVE rate. They normally agree to within a few
hundredths of a point, and the rate box on the Net Carry tab stays editable.
